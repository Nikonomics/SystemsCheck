# Focus Areas Model Validation Results

## Validation Methodology

For each clinical system, we analyzed ~19,000 survey pairs (survey 1 → survey 2 within 2 years) to determine if citations in a system on survey 1 predict citations in that system on survey 2.

## Results Summary

| System | None→Cited | Low(1)→Cited | Med(2)→Cited | High(3+)→Cited | Lift |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|------|
| 1. Change of Condition | 80.4% | 85.1% | 88.7% | 94.3% | 1.17 |
| 2. Accidents/Falls | 43.8% | 55.8% | 67.4% | 75.3% | **1.72** |
| 3. Skin | 34.3% | 44.1% | 56.6% | 69.5% | **2.03** |
| 4. Med Management | 67.5% | 74.9% | 81.6% | 88.6% | 1.31 |
| 5. Infection Control | 47.5% | 58.7% | 65.5% | 71.0% | 1.50 |
| 6. Transfer/Discharge | 11.6% | 17.7% | 24.5% | 33.1% | **2.85** |
| 7. Abuse/Grievances | 18.1% | 26.3% | 32.8% | 32.9% | 1.81 |

**Lift** = High(3+) cited rate / None cited rate

## Key Findings

### 1. Model Has Strong Predictive Power

All 7 systems show a clear monotonic relationship: more citations → higher probability of future citations.

### 2. Highest Predictive Power Systems

**Transfer/Discharge (Lift: 2.85)**
- Facilities with 3+ prior citations are nearly 3x more likely to be cited again
- Suggests systemic discharge planning issues persist

**Skin (Lift: 2.03)**
- Facilities with 3+ prior skin citations are 2x more likely to be cited again
- Pressure injury prevention is a persistent challenge

**Accidents/Falls (Lift: 1.72)**
- High-risk facilities significantly more likely to have repeat fall citations

### 3. Lowest Predictive Differentiation

**Change of Condition (Lift: 1.17)**
- Very high base rate (80.4% cited even with no prior)
- This system is ubiquitous - most facilities get cited regardless of history
- Model still useful but less differentiation

### 4. Moderate Base Rates

**Infection Control & Falls** have ~45% base rate (no prior → cited)
- These represent genuine risk areas where improvement is possible
- Good targets for Focus Area recommendations

### 5. Low Base Rates

**Transfer/Discharge & Abuse** have <20% base rate
- Less common citations overall
- But when they occur, they strongly predict future issues

## Implications for Focus Areas

1. **System Risk Scores are validated** - Previous citation history does predict future citations

2. **Citation weight is appropriate** at 40% of total score

3. **Repeat F-tag bonus is justified** - Repeat citations indicate persistent issues

4. **System-specific recommendations are actionable** - Facilities can focus on high-risk systems

## Validation Data

- Time period: 2020-01-01 to present
- Survey pairs analyzed: ~19,000 per system
- All standard health inspections included
- Survey 2 must be within 2 years of Survey 1

## Conclusion

The Focus Areas model demonstrates strong predictive validity. Facilities identified as high-risk in a clinical system are significantly more likely to be cited in that system on subsequent surveys. The citation-based System Risk Score is a valid indicator of future survey outcomes.

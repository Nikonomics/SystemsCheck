# Observations & Interview Tab - Context Document

## Purpose
This is a **quick reference/checklist sheet** that consolidates all observation and interview items from across the assessment tabs. It serves as a field guide for assessors to use during their facility walkthrough and staff interviews.

## Sheet Structure

### Column Layout
| Column | Header | Content |
|--------|--------|---------|
| A | "Observations:" | List of observation items |
| B | "Notes" | Space for observation notes |

| D | "Notes:" | Space for interview notes |

### Observation Items (Column A, Rows 2-15)

| Row | Observation Item | Source Tab |

| 3 | Safe Environment / free from Environmental Hazards on observation: F689 (Sample 3) | 2. Accidents, Falls |

| 5 | Observe one wound treatment completed by Nurse or Treatment Nurse. Observe treat completed per MD order with sterile technique | 3. Skin |
| 6 | Pressure relief devices are in place and working correctly (e.g., heel protectors, specialty mattresses) | 3. Skin |

| 8 | Observation: HOB elevated if applicable, IV Pole and pump are clean, enteral bag dated | 4. Med Mgmt/Weight |
| 9 | Review: Current infections are Tracked and Trended including mapping of infections at minimum | 5. Infection Control |
| 10 | Observation of cleaning process of glucometers in between Resident use with evidence of cleaning documentation | 5. Infection Control |
| 11 | Observation of cleaning process of vital sign equipment in between Resident use with evidence of cleaning documentation | 5. Infection Control |
| 12 | Staff Sample: Appropriate PPE Use: Interview/Observe staff re: appropriate use of PPE | 5. Infection Control |
| 13 | Review: Facility implements hand washing/hygiene procedures to be followed by staff | 5. Infection Control |
| 14 | Observation: Facility and equipment are clean. Yes/No (hoyers/med carts, doors, tub rooms, equipment storage) | 5. Infection Control |
| 15 | Observation: Random shower room checks - shower room clean and free from dirty linen | 5. Infection Control |

## Formatting

## Purpose and Use

### For Assessors
This sheet serves as a **walking checklist** during facility rounds:
1. Print this sheet or use on a tablet
2. Check off observations as completed
3. Use "Notes" columns for real-time documentation
4. Cross-reference back to main assessment tabs for scoring

### Observation Categories

#### Safety & Fall Prevention
- Fall intervention verification
- Environmental hazard assessment
- Safe transfer observation

#### Wound Care
- Treatment observation
- Sterile technique compliance
- Pressure relief devices

#### Nutrition Support
- HOB (Head of Bed) positioning for enteral feeding
- IV/feeding equipment cleanliness
- Dating of supplies

#### Infection Prevention
- Infection tracking review
- Equipment cleaning processes
- PPE compliance
- Hand hygiene
- Environmental cleanliness
- Shower room checks

## Cross-Reference to Assessment Tabs

| Observation | Score on Tab | Points |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Fall interventions | 2. Accidents, Falls | 5 pts |
| Environmental hazards | 2. Accidents, Falls | 5 pts |
| Transfer observation | 2. Accidents, Falls | 10 pts |
| Wound treatment | 3. Skin | 10 pts |
| Pressure relief | 3. Skin | 10 pts |
| HOB/enteral observation | 4. Med Mgmt | 5 pts |
| Glucometer cleaning | 5. Infection Control | 10 pts |
| Vital signs cleaning | 5. Infection Control | 10 pts |
| PPE use | 5. Infection Control | 10 pts |
| Hand hygiene | 5. Infection Control | 10 pts |
| Equipment cleanliness | 5. Infection Control | 10 pts |
| Shower rooms | 5. Infection Control | 10 pts |

## Staff Interview Topics (Column C)
The original template shows Column C header "Staff Interviews:" but does not include specific interview items in the rows. Consider adding:
- Abuse recognition and reporting procedures
- Fall intervention knowledge
- PPE use requirements
- Hand hygiene protocols
- Isolation precautions

## Recommended Additions for This Sheet

### Interview Questions to Add
1. "What types of abuse should be reported?"
2. "What is the fall prevention protocol for high-risk residents?"
3. "When do you wear PPE and what type?"
4. "How do you clean equipment between residents?"
5. "What do you do if you observe signs of infection?"

### Timing Guide
| Observation Type | Suggested Duration |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Environmental round | 30-45 minutes |
| Treatment observation | 15-20 minutes |
| Transfer observation | 10-15 minutes |
| Equipment checks | 20-30 minutes |
| Staff interviews (3) | 15-20 minutes total |

## Implementation Notes

### When Recreating This Sheet
1. Keep layout simple - it's a field reference
2. Consider making it printable on one page
3. Add checkboxes for completed items
4. Include space for timestamps
5. Consider adding a "Location" column for environmental observations

### Integration with Other Tabs
- All observations feed into corresponding assessment tabs
- Notes taken here support narrative documentation
- This sheet does not calculate scores - scoring happens on individual tabs

## Best Practices for Use
1. Complete observations during natural workflow (meal times, med pass, treatments)
2. Use unobtrusive observation techniques
3. Document immediately rather than from memory
4. Note specific locations and times for environmental issues
5. Interview staff during natural pauses in their work
